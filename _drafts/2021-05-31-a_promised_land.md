## Quotations

### Preface

> More than anyone, this book is for those young people - an invitation to once again remake the world, and to bring about, through hard work, determination, and a big dose of imagination, an America that finally aligns with all that is best in us. (p.xvi)

### Part One. The Bet

> Once, when she discovered I had been part of a group that was teasing a kid at school, she sat me down in front of her, lips pursed with disappointment. "You know, Barry", sh said. (...) "there are people in the world who think only about themselves. They don\'t care what happens to other people down to make themselves feel important. Then there are people who do the opposite, who are able to imagine how others must feel, and make sure that they don't do things that hurt people." "So", she said, looking me squarely  in the eye. "Which kind of person do you want to be?". I felt lousy. As she intended it to, her question stayed with me for a long time.  (pp.6-7)
>
> I didn\'t talk to anyone about this, certainly not my friends or family. I didn't want to hurt their feelings or stand out more than I already did. But I did find refuge in books. The reading habit was my mother's doing, instilled early in my childhood (...) *Go read books, she would say. Then come back and tell me something  you learned* (p.9)
>
> Much of what I read I only dimly understood; I took to circling unfamiliar words to look up in the dictionary, although I was less scrupulous about decoding pronunciations - deep into my twenties I would know the meaning of words I couldn't pronounce. (p.10)
>
> I saw the possibility of practicing the values my mother had taught me; how you could build power not by putting others down but by lifting them up. This was true democracy at work - democracy not as a gift from on high, or a division of spoils between interest groups, but rather a democracy that was earned, the work of everybody. The result was not just a change in material conditions but a sense of dignity for people and communities, a bond between those who had once seemed far apart. (p.11) 
>
> For three years in New York, (...) I lived like a monk - reading, writing, filling up journals, rarely bothering with college parties or even eating hot meals. I got lost in my head, preoccupied with questions that seemed to layer themselves one over the next. What made some movements succeed where others failed? Was it a sign of success when portions of a cause were absorbed by conventional politics, or was it a sign that the cause had been hijacked? When was compromise acceptable and when was it selling out, and how did one know the difference? (p.11-12)
>
> Such was my state when I graduate in 1983; big idea and nowhere to go. There wwere no movements to join, no sselfless leader to foloow. The closest I could find to what I had in mind was something called "community organizing" - grassroots work that brought ordinary people together around issues of local concern. After bouncing around in a couple of ill-fitting jobs in New York, I heard about a position in Chicago, working with a group of churches that were trying to stabilize communities racked by steel plan closures. **Nothing grand, but a place to start** (p.14)
>
> As law schoold was coming to an end, I told Michelle of my plan. I wouldn't clerk. I\'d move back to Chicago, try to keep my hand in community work while also practicing law at a small firm that specialized in civil rights. If a good opportunity presented itself, I said, I could even see myself running for office (...) "I can try, can't I?" I said with a smile. "What's the point of having a fancy law degree if you can't take some risks? If it doesn't  work, it doesn't work. I'll be okay. We'll be okay" (p.22)
